# YouTube Clone

## Description

This repository contains two versions of a simple YouTube clone built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project, created by Putluru Aravinda Reddy, aims to showcase basic video streaming functionality without the use of any frameworks. It includes two variations:

1. **YouTube Clone with API:**
   - This version utilizes the YouTube API for video playback. It allows users to search and play YouTube videos directly within the clone.

   - **Demo:** [YouTube Clone with API](https://putluruaravindareddy.github.io/Youtube_clone/)

2. **YouTube Clone without API:**
   - This version does not use any external API for video playback. It provides a simple interface but does not support video playback functionality.
